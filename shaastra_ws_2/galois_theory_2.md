### Some general points

We will be analyzing Galois Theory
through an example

We will prove theorems along the way

The example we will take is $f = t^4 - 3$, whose
roots are clearly $\eta, -\eta, i \eta, -i \eta$,
where $\eta = \sqrt[4]{3}$.

---

### 1. Splitting Field

A splitting field of a polynomial
is the field generated by the 
roots of a polynomial

For our example, the
splitting field is $K = \mathbb Q(\eta, -\eta, i \eta, -i \eta)$,
which is also represented as $\mathbb Q(i, \eta)$

---

### 2. Degree of $K$ in $\mathbb Q$

Consider $K$ to be a vector
space in $Q$. We will find the
degree of $K$ in $Q$

Consider three field extensions
$K : \mathbb Q(\eta), \mathbb Q(\eta): \mathbb Q(\eta^2), \mathbb Q(\eta^2): \mathbb Q$

---

## Finding $[\mathbb Q(\eta^2): \mathbb Q]$

### We will prove that $\{ 1, \sqrt 3\}$
### is a basis

Linear independence: Let $w \in \mathbb Q(\eta^2)$
Let $w = a + b \sqrt 3, a, b, \in \mathbb Q = 0, a, b \ne 0$
$\implies \sqrt 3 = \frac ab$
But as $\sqrt 3$ is irrational, this is a contradiction

So, $a = b = 0$

---

## Theorem 3: $[\mathbb Q(\eta^2): \mathbb Q]$

### We will prove that $\{ 1, \sqrt 3\}$
### is a basis

# 

Span: Follows trivially from definition

Hence, $[\mathbb Q(\eta^2): \mathbb Q] = 2$

---

## Finding $[\mathbb Q(\eta): \mathbb Q(\eta^2)]$

### We will prove that $\{ 1, \sqrt [4] 3\}$
### is a basis

Let $w \in \mathbb Q(\eta)$
$w = a + b \eta + c \eta^2 + d \eta^3, a, b, c, d \in \mathbb Q$

$w = a + c \eta^2 + \eta (b + d \eta^2)$

$w = 0 \implies a + c \eta^2 = b + d \eta^2 = 0$

$\implies a = b = c = d = 0$

---

## Finding $[\mathbb Q(\eta): \mathbb Q(\eta^2)]$

### We will prove that $\{ 1, \sqrt [4] 3\}$
### is a basis

# 

Span: Follows trivially from definition

Hence, $[\mathbb Q(\eta): \mathbb Q(\eta^2)] = 2$

---

Similarly, $[\mathbb Q (\eta, i) : \mathbb Q (\eta) ] = 2$

## Degree of $K$ in $\mathbb Q$

### Tower Law

For subfields $K \subseteq L \subseteq M$, $[M : K] = [M : L][L : K]$

$[K : \mathbb Q] = [K : \mathbb Q (\eta)] [\mathbb Q (\eta) : \mathbb Q (\eta^2)][\mathbb Q (\eta^2): \mathbb Q]$
$[K : \mathbb Q] = 2 \times 2 \times 2 = \boxed{8}$

Hence, the degree of $K$ in $\mathbb Q$ is 8

### 3. Symmetries of the Roots

- This is arguably the most
beautiful part of Galois theory

- This talks about the roots in a
given field extension

- We will start by finding all
the $\mathbb Q$-automorphisms

---

### $\mathbb Q$-automorphism

An automorphism is a bijective
homomorphism from a set
to itself

In our case, we want bijective
homomorphisms from $K \to K$,
such that elements of $\mathbb Q$
remain fixed!

---

### $\mathbb Q$-automorphism

For instance, consider $\sigma (\eta) = i \eta$

To prove that elements of $\mathbb Q$
remain fixed, consider $3 = \eta \times i \eta \times - \eta \times -i \eta$

If we apply $\sigma$,
$3 = i \eta \times i^2 \eta \times - i \eta \times -i i \eta$
As $3$ is fixed, $1 = \frac 33$ also remains fixed

If $1$ is fixed, $\mathbb N$ and hence $\mathbb Q$ if fixed

---

### $\mathbb Q$-automorphism

Also consider $\tau(i) = - i$

To prove that elements of $\mathbb Q$
remain fixed, consider $3 = \eta \times i \eta \times - \eta \times -i \eta$

If we apply $\tau$,
$\eta \times - i \eta \times - \eta \times i \eta$
As $3$ is fixed, $1 = \frac 33$ also remains fixed

If $1$ is fixed, $\mathbb N$ and hence $\mathbb Q$ if fixed

---

### $\mathbb Q$-automorphism

- Identity function is also a $\mathbb Q$-automorphism

- If $\sigma$ is a $\mathbb Q$-automorphism,
$\sigma \sigma$ is also a $\mathbb Q$-automorphism.
This is the function $\sigma^2 (\eta) = - \eta$

- Intuitively, the $\mathbb Q$-automorphisms
for a \text{Group} under composition

- This Group is called the Galois group!

### Galois Group

Add image of D4

### 4. Inclusion Diagram

Add image

---

### 5. Fixed field

Consider an operation $\dagger$ on
an element $H$ of the Galois group

This is an operation from $\{ \text{subsets of } G\}$
$\to \{ \text{subfields of} \} K$

Under this operation, some subfield
of $K$ will be fixed. The 'largest' 
such subfield is the fixed field.

---

### $\{1, \tau \}^\dagger$

We want to find the subfield fixed by $\tau$,
i.e. the field which is fixed if $i \to -i$

Intuitively, $B^{\dagger} = Q(\eta)$
As $Q(\eta)$ is purely real, it is a fixed field

---

### $\{1, \tau \}^\dagger$

To prove that there is no larger subfield which
is fixed, consider K, the only larger subfield.

Note that $i = \frac{i \eta}{\eta}$
$\tau (i) = \frac{-i \eta}{\eta} \ne i$

So, it is not fixed

---

### The $\dagger$ operation

Note that we could do the $\dagger$
operation on every subgroup of G

We will end up with the 
fixed fields of each of the subgroups.

As a sidenote, $\forall H \subseteq G$, 
$|H| = [H^\dagger : \mathbb Q]$

### 6. Some observations

The deep symmetry is the \textbf{Galois correspondence}

It is the bijection
between subgroups of the Galois groups ($\mathfrak G$)
and subfields of the field K ($\mathfrak F$)

### Compass and Straightedge Constructions

- We are allowed only a compass
and an \textit{unmarked} ruler

- If a point $(x, y)$ can be obtained
by compass and straightedge,
we call it constructible

- It is natural to associate a
field to this construction

---

Assume we are given an initial
set of points $P_0 = (x_0, y_0)$

One step means intersection
of two lines, two circles, or
one line and one circle

Now, the set of all the points
we can reach from $P_0$ in one
step would be $P_1$.

---

Let $K_i$ be field of all numbers
generated by $x_i$ and $y_i$

Say $P_0 = {(0, 0), (0, 1)}$
$K_0 = \mathbb Q$

In one construction, we can
construct say $P_1 = {0, \sqrt 2}$

---

### Detailed example

Say you wanted to create $\sqrt[4]2$
from $P_0 = {(0, 0), (0, 1)}$

Draw a right triangle with sides 1,
so that its hypotenuse would be $\sqrt 2$

### Go to image

$K_0 = \mathbb Q$, $K_1 = \mathbb Q(\sqrt 2)$, $K_2 = \mathbb Q(\sqrt[4]{2})$

---

## Theorem 4

$x_j, y_j \in K_j$ are zeroes of quad. polynomials in $K_{j - 1}$

### Proof

Note that $$x_j, y_j$$ must
be the intersection of

1. Line and Circle
2. Line and Line
3. Circle and Circle

---

### 1. Line and Circle

Line passes through $(p, q), (r, s), p, q, r, s \in K_{j - 1}$
$\implies \frac{x - p}{r - p} = \frac{y - q}{s - q}$

Circle has center $(t, u)$, radius $w$, $t, u, w \in K_{j - 1}$
$(x - t)^2 + (y - u)^2 =  w^2$

$(x - t)^2 + (\frac{s - q}{r - p} (x - p) + q - u)^2 = w^2$
Likewise for $y$

$x, y \in K_j$ are zeroes in $K_{j - 1}$

---

# Theorem 4

$x_j, y_j \in K_j$ are zeroes of quadratic polynomials in $K_{j - 1}$

### Proof

2. Line and Line
3. Circle and Circle

Can be done as an exercise

Conclusion: $[K_j : K_{j - 1}] = 1$ or $2$

---

# Theorem 5

Consider a constructible point $P$. Then, $P$
is constructible by some tower of fields,
and let $K(P) = K_n$

$[K_n : \mathbb Q]$ is some power of 2

Note the contradiction also: if $[K_n : \mathbb Q]$
is not a power of 2, $P$ is not constructible

---

# Trisecting a general angle

Say we want to trisect $\frac \pi 3$
So, we want an angle $\frac \pi 9$.

If we want to construct $\frac \pi 9$,
we need our field to contain
$\sin \frac \pi 9 = 2^{- \frac 43} (\sqrt[3] {i - \sqrt 3} - \sqrt[3] {i + \sqrt 3})$
and $\cos \frac \pi 9 = 2^{- \frac 43} (\sqrt[3] {1 +  i \sqrt 3} + \sqrt[3] {1 - i \sqrt 3})$

It can be proven that $[\mathbb Q(\sin \frac \pi 9, \cos \frac \pi 9) : \mathbb Q] = 3$

# Insolvability of the Quintic
#

## What does it mean?

A polynomial is solvable by radicals
if you can write its roots 
in terms of its coefficients,
4 arithmetic operations, and nth roots

It means that the general quintic 
is not solvable by radicals

---

## What does it mean?

Some particular quintics
are certainly solvable by radicals

### Example
$t^5 - 1$ is solvable by radicals

Roots are $1, \alpha, \alpha^2, \alpha^3, \alpha^4$
where $\alpha = \frac {(\sqrt{5} - 1)} 4 + i \sqrt{\frac 58 + \frac{\sqrt 5}{8}}$

---

### Solvable Groups

$G$ is solvable if it has a finite
series of subgroups such that 
$1 = G_0 = \subseteq G_1 \dots \subseteq G_n = G$,
such that 
1. $G_i \triangleleft G_{i + 1}$
2. $G_{i + 1} / G_i$ is abelian


---

## Intuitive explanation 

1. For a polynomial, look at its
Galois group $\Gamma$

2. Check solvability of the $\Gamma$

3. If $\Gamma$ is solvable, the roots
can be expressed by radicals

---

### The Symmetric Group

The group of all permutations of
$(1, 2, \dots,  n)$ is $\mathbb S_n$

Note that $\mathbb S_1, \mathbb S_2$ are
trivially solvable

$\mathbb S_3$ is solvable, as there is
a nice sequence, $1 \triangleleft \mathbb C_3 \triangleleft \mathbb S_3$

$\mathbb S_4$ is also solvable

---

### $\mathbb S_5$ is not solvable

Consider the normal subgroups of $\mathbb S_5$

One such subgroup is $\mathbb A_5$, 
which is the alternating group, 
the set of even permutations

But, $\mathbb A_5$ is not solvable,
hence $\mathbb S_5$ is not solvable

---

### Specific Example $t^5 - 6t + 3$

Now, this polynomial's Galois group
is the group is $\mathbb S_5$

Thus, that Galois group is not solvable

Hence, the polynomial is not
solvable by radicals!
